Funkyenough's Personal Website

This project is built with create-next-app, including NextJS 13, typescript, tailwindcss. Didn't use the app directory because the feature was still experimental at the time of making.

Current highlight of the project is the Zotero API integration. The API fetches the latest item added to my zotero collection, displays the item parameters and provides a link to the source of the material. The idea is that the visitor of this website knows what I am reading recently. Currently there is an active effort to implement a server that records the data fetched from Zotero to reduce load time.

There are some other interesting applications that I have in mind that I wish to embed in the website, but have not found a way to do so.

Styling is still mostly absent, but will be added soon.
